# Smart Document Assistant üìö

## Overview

The Smart Document Assistant is an AI-powered interactive tool built with Streamlit that allows users to seamlessly interact with their documents. It leverages advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, Google's Gemini API, and a local ChromaDB instance to provide intelligent Q&A, comprehensive summarization, and an engaging "Challenge Me" quiz mode based on your uploaded content. This project aims to transform how you absorb information from lengthy documents by making it interactive and efficient.

## Features

- **Document Upload & Processing**: Easily upload PDF and text (.txt) documents for analysis and interaction.

- **Intelligent Q&A**: Ask questions about your document, and receive accurate answers grounded in the document's content, complete with justifications.

- **Automatic Summarization**: Get concise summaries of uploaded documents to quickly grasp the main points.

- **Challenge Mode**: Test your comprehension with AI-generated, logic-based questions derived from the document. The system also evaluates your answers and provides detailed justifications and scores.

- **Persistent Chat Sessions**: Your chat history, document uploads, and generated data are automatically saved and can be reloaded for continuous interaction across sessions, thanks to ChromaDB.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Utilizes a robust RAG pipeline with ChromaDB for efficient semantic search and context retrieval, ensuring answers are directly relevant to the document content.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive and interactive web application built with Streamlit for a smooth user experience.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-document-assistant.git
cd smart-document-assistant
```

### 2. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install the required Python packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set up Google Gemini API Key

1. Obtain your `GEMINI_API_KEY` from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

### 6. Install Poppler (for pdf2image)

pdf2image requires Poppler to be installed on your system.

**Windows**: Download a pre-compiled binary from [here](https://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/). Extract it and add the bin directory to your system's PATH.

**macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install poppler
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

### 7. Install Tesseract OCR (for pytesseract)

pytesseract requires Tesseract OCR to be installed on your system.

**Windows**: Download the installer from the [Tesseract GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). Make sure to add it to your system's PATH during installation, or manually set the `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd` variable in `mod.py`.

**macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

## Usage

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command from the project's root directory while your virtual environment is active:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will open the application in your web browser.
